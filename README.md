<h1>SR9011 vs RAD150: My Honest Review After Running Both</h1>

<p>I‚Äôve used <strong>SR9011</strong> and <strong>RAD150</strong> in separate cycles to test how they work in real life‚Äînot just on paper. They‚Äôre completely different animals. RAD150 is all about muscle and strength. SR9011? It‚Äôs a cutting machine. Here‚Äôs what you need to know before picking one.</p>

<h2>How I Tested These SARMs</h2>
<p>I don‚Äôt just read studies. I run full cycles, take notes, track training, and measure body comp. Here‚Äôs how I tested both:</p>
<ul>
  <li>8-week solo cycles, no stacking</li>
  <li>Same calories and macros across both runs</li>
  <li>Trained 5x a week, strength and hypertrophy focus</li>
  <li>Used bloodwork and DEXA scans to track changes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want real-world, tested info ‚Äî not just guesswork ‚Äî this is it.</p>

<h2>What Is RAD150?</h2>
<p><strong>RAD150</strong> (aka TLB-150) is an upgraded version of RAD140. It‚Äôs esterified, which means it lasts longer and hits harder. It‚Äôs powerful for building strength and muscle mass. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/rad150-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this RAD150 from Chemyo</a> for my cycle.</p>

<h3>My RAD150 Results</h3>
<p>By week 3, my lifts shot up fast. I gained 6‚Äì7 lbs of lean mass, looked full, and felt like a machine in the gym. Pumps were next level. Recovery between sets improved. But sleep started getting spotty around week 6, and I definitely felt test suppression creeping in.</p>

<h3>RAD150 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fast strength gains</li>
  <li>Hard, dry muscle look</li>
  <li>No liver toxicity</li>
  <li>Longer half-life = steady blood levels</li>
</ul>

<h3>RAD150 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mild testosterone suppression</li>
  <li>Can cause insomnia later in the cycle</li>
  <li>Not made for fat loss or cutting</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, recomposition, strength</h4>

<h2>What Is SR9011?</h2>
<p><strong>SR9011</strong> is a Rev-ErbA agonist, not technically a SARM, but it‚Äôs often used in the same space. It‚Äôs famous for boosting fat loss, endurance, and metabolic activity. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SR9011 from Chemyo</a> solo for 8 weeks.</p>

<h3>My SR9011 Results</h3>
<p>I started this cut at about 14% body fat. By the end, I was around 10%. I didn‚Äôt lose much strength, but cardio felt like it doubled. Resting heart rate dropped, energy was smooth, and recovery was faster. I felt like a machine in the mornings. SR9011 literally made my metabolism feel ‚Äúfaster.‚Äù</p>

<h3>SR9011 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Serious fat loss ‚Äî especially stubborn fat</li>
  <li>Great for endurance and cardio training</li>
  <li>No hormonal suppression</li>
  <li>No PCT needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>SR9011 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Short half-life ‚Äî needs 2‚Äì3 doses daily</li>
  <li>No muscle-building power</li>
  <li>Some people feel mild fatigue after week 6</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, endurance, cardio boost</h4>
